Delta Stepping Algorithm
========================

During this work I implemented on Julia  The delta stepping algorithm proppossed by [Meyer and Sanders] in 1998. This implementation split the Dijikstra algorithm  in phases so that each phase can be implemented on parallel. 

The purpouse of this algorithm is to solve the so called SSSP problem (Single Source Shortest Path Problem). That can be stated as follows:

``Given a weighted graph G=(V,E,c) where:

* V is a Set of vertices or nodes

* E is a set of edges, i.e., ordered pairs of nodes 

* c cost or weight function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, 

Find a minimal weight path from one chose node $s \in V$ called the ** source node**, to all other nodes in V. We say that the nodes $v,w \in V$ are neighbours if $(v,w) \in E$, i.e., if there exists and edge between them.``
